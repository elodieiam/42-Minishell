# Minishell Project 🔧
The minishell project at 42 School is a **dual project** that involves **creating a simple Unix shell**. 

This project is designed to deepen our understanding of **shell scripting**, **command parsing**, and **process management**. 🖥️

Our group decided to further explore the project by **implementing additional optional features**, including handling parentheses, as well as logical operators && and ||, as part of the bonus objectives.

We ensured that signals were properly handled in both **parent and child processes**, all while maintaining a **leak-free environment**.


## Features 📋
1. **Command Parsing:** Parse and execute user commands.
2. **Built-in Commands:** Implement common shell built-in commands like cd, echo, exit, etc.
3. **Process Management:** Handle foreground and background processes.
4. **Signal Handling:** Manage signals for a seamless user experience.

## Objectives 🎯
1. Master shell scripting and command parsing.
2. Develop robust process management techniques.
3. Improve understanding of Unix-based systems.
